# LAS-Twitterbot
Hopefully, soon to be the [Louisville Animal Services' Twitterbot](https://twitter.com/LouMetroAnimals)

Inspired and based upon the [twitterbot](https://github.com/BMGhack/BMGPetBot) by BMGHack. This bot is written in R while their's is written in Python. They also pulled their data from the city of Bloomington, Indiana's 'adoptable animals' site but also, included code that pulled data from the API at [petfinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs). This code gets it's data from that API.
